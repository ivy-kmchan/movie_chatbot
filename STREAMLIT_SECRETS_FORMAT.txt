Copy and paste EXACTLY this format into Streamlit Cloud Secrets:
(Replace the values with your actual API keys)

[openai]
api_key = "sk-proj-your-actual-openai-key-here"

[omdb]
api_key = "your-actual-omdb-key-here"

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Make sure there are NO extra spaces before or after the keys
- The OpenAI key should start with "sk-" or "sk-proj-"
- The quotes around the keys are required
- Do NOT include any comments or extra text
- The section names [openai] and [omdb] must be lowercase
- Make sure to click "Save" after pasting

Example (with fake keys):
[openai]
api_key = "sk-proj-abc123xyz789"

[omdb]
api_key = "a1b2c3d4"
